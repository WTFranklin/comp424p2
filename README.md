Project Phase 2 Rubric: 5% Code Review Analysis and 12% Implementation (and report), 3% Presentation and Demo.

In your presentation (as well as your report) you should give a quick overview of your implementation. What works and what does not work. You should also include your design choices (for security) and support your decisions compared to alternatives. 

Time breakdown (per group):
 - Presentation: 7 minutes
 - Demo: 3 minutes

You *must* ensure your presentation will not exceed 10 minutes, so time it wisely.

Note that not all members need to be part of the presentation team. 

All presentations will take place on the second part of the lecture on Nov. 29th.
